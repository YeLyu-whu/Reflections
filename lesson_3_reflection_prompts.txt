When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my file with others, seen or used by others, 
    I really do want to push the file on website.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe the github website is used by multiple users, and you do not 
    want to update whenever there is a commit by other users. These commits
    may even interrupt your current work with conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: used when copying others' repository on GitHub webpage to my GitHub webpage.
    clones: used to clone repository from remote to local. Or from local to local.
    Branches: used locally to create other version of my work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
