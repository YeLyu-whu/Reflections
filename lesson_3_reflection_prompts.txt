When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my file with others, seen or used by others, 
    I really do want to push the file on website.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe the github website is used by multiple users, and you do not 
    want to update whenever there is a commit by other users. These commits
    may even interrupt your current work with conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: used when copying others' repository on GitHub webpage to my GitHub webpage.
    clones: used to clone repository from remote to local. Or from local to local.
    Branches: used locally to create other version of my work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is easy to find where our current commit is, which can be useful when
    we try to push or pull from origin.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without github, I have to directly talk to the person what I have changed,
    and have to send files to others. I will not have to maintain my fork, but
    I have to deal with a lot of communication and it is not easy to roll back.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If I do not want to contaminate my work in master branch, I will branch.
    If I work directly on master, I can update my work immediate, but, it is
    very difficult to roll back.
